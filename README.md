# FxPortal Project

This is the first project on Polygon-Advance,  I deployed NFTs on the Ethereum Goerli network. Then, I approved and finally deposited from Ethereum to Polygon using  the Polygon Bridge.

npm install
```

### Deploying the ERC721A Contract

Before deploying, make sure to rename ".env.example" to ".env" and provide your wallet private key where required i.e "PRIVATE_KEY= 'your wallet private key'". Run the following command to deploy the ERC721A contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet:

``` shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 
```

The script will deploy the contract and provide the address of the contract in the console and also in the "contractAddress.js" file in the metadata folder.

### Batch Mint NFTs

Run the following command to batch mint NFTs using the deployed ERC721 contract:

``` shell
npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network goerli

The script will mint the specified number of NFTs and assign them to your address.
